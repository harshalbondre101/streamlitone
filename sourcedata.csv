The status icons for the watch are all messed up and not correct in the app. It would be nice to be able to customize the watch faces beyond what they give you as the selections are pretty lackluster.

As for the app, its aesthetically appealing, but it suffers from not having many features.

There are a few messages/tips that come up after setting up the app they are not really easy to note and I often missed them. For a first time user such notifications if prominently displayed could be very helpful. There is no automatic activity tracker that is slightly disappointing but I knew what I was getting into. Google fit is able to do the same without any device. GPS integration with the band seems very unpredictable. It works sometimes but not always. All the required permissions are given and double-checked. Battery optimisation is turned off too. The major disappointment is the integration with google fit. This app is blocked by google which means oneplus has not yet met the google requirements. I urge the developers to periodically provide updates and fix these issues. Sleep detection algorithm is completely off the mark, app detects awake time when I am not. Sleep statistics is not adequately descriptive. This requires major improvement.
